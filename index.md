# Adam Braun

I am a maths PhD student at L2s laboratory in Paris-Saclay, France. My research interests include Partial Differential Equations, 
infinite-dimensional systems robust control of hyperbolic systems, 
delay systems, networks, and interconnected systems, 
observer design for nonlinear or infinite dimensional dynamical systems.
